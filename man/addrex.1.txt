NAME
       addrex - IP/Mac Address Extractor

SYNOPSIS
       addrex FILE [-m THRESHOLD] [-i THRESHOLD] [-d OUTPUT_DIR]

DESCRIPTION
       Find  and  extract  IP and MAC addresses in FILE. Addresses with repeat
       occurrences greater than or equal to a given threshold  are  logged  to
       ip_addrs.txt  and mac_addrs.txt respectively. By default, MAC addresses
       that occur at least 8 times are logged and IP addresses that  occur  at
       least  10  times are logged. All matches are performed as case insensi-
       tive.

OPTIONS
       -m     Set the MAC address threshold, defaults to 8

       -i     Set the IP address threshold, defaults to 10

       -d     Specify directory where MAC and IP output files are written  to,
	      defaults to current directory

FORMATS
       Matches the following address formats:

       o   IPv4: standard format a.b.c.d

       o   IPv6: canonical format a:b:c:d:e:f:g:h

       o   IPv6: compressed format a::b

       o   IPv6: IPv4 mapped IPv6 format a:b:c:d:e:f:w.x.y.z

       o   IPv6: compressed IPv4 mapped IPv6 format a::b:w.x.y.z

       o   MAC: Separated by '-' aa-bb-cc-dd-ee-ff

       o   MAC: Separated by ':' aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff



NOTE ON LARGE FILES
       Depending  on  how large the file is, this utility can take a long time
       to complete: for a 512MB file with (5 million)  entries	it  took  just
       over 3 min -- YMMV depending on your hardware
